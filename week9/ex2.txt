Decreasing:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 ... infinity or other number that is not used, and not be used in near future.
Behaviour of hit/miss is decreasing, because we always reference page that is not in memory, so number of misses will increase, while number of hits will stay unchanged.

Increasing:
1 2 ... n 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1... or other numbers from first n numbers, if frame page number is n or more.
Behaviour of hit/miss is increasing, because we always reference page that is already in memory, so number of hits will increase, while number of misses will stay unchanged(n).
