Buffer_size is reversely proportinal to time
Obviously, more weight of the file more time you need to wait.
With O_SYNC it requires much more time, because without O_SYNC program uses DMA, but with O_SYNC program data goes to cache.

Without O_SYNC:

buffer size is 20 bytes:
real	0m0,750s
user	0m0,043s
sys	0m0,673s

buffer size is 100 bytes:
real	0m0,184s
user	0m0,009s
sys	0m0,156s

buffer size is 10 bytes:
real	0m1,461s
user	0m0,083s
sys	0m1,340s

with O_SYNC:

buffer size is 1000 bytes:
real	0m21,235s
user	0m0,000s
sys	0m1,452s

buffer size is 500 bytes:
real	1m0,578s
user	0m0,024s
sys	0m2,504s

I tried 100 bytes, but it takes 4m without input, so I canceled command.
