If we have only physical addresses, then sometimes when we will not have something, because physical memory is not that large to contain all information that needed for the process, we would need to retrive addresses from memory, which is longer it terms of time. Virtual addresses help us to save this time. Virtual address generally have more entries, to fit all nesessary information for process. Also virtual addresses are located contigously to save space.
